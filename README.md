# Ticketing-EstimationPrototype
This is a project for Microsoft Dyanmics 365's Business Central.
I designed it with the inital goal of having a modular ticketing system.
With the starting issue being that a lot of work is generated by leaving and entering BC, and having a ticketing system through freshdesk is a key time waster,
and I attached the estimator along to give a sort of taste for how new features could be keyed in relatively easily.
This has not been put into use as of the inital upload of this project (9/26/2023), and the first draft was made over a weekend in july, with bits and pieces added over the last two months.
The most recent update was last week, adding in functionality to email either the person who accepted or submitted the ticket to inform them of notes being left.

To note, certain ticket Number Series are hardcoded in (See: engtix), so I would like to go back at some point and add a table to tie ticket uses to their number series, and just reference that.
But I think some user feedback is necessary before any more major changes are made.

All in all, I'm pretty pleased with how this turned out, since there is not functionality natively in BC for tickets, nor estimations, both of which are pretty heavily relied on at my work.
